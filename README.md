                              PDF Generation Project

1.)Objective:

->To develop a service that dynamically generates invoices in PDF format based on seller, buyer, and item details.

2.)Technologies Used:

->Java: Core programming language.

->Spring Boot: To implement and manage the service.

->iText (lowagie): Library for creating and manipulating PDF files.

->JUnit: For unit testing.

->Mockito: For mocking during testing.


3.)Key Features:

->Generates a PDF containing:

->Seller details (name, GSTIN, address).

->Buyer details (name, GSTIN, address).

->List of items (name, quantity, rate, and total amount).

->Handles empty or missing data gracefully.

->Returns the file path of the generated PDF.

->Supports exception handling for issues like file I/O errors.

3.)TDD Implementation:

->Developed with Test-Driven Development, ensuring robust and error-free code.

->Unit tests cover:

  .Successful PDF generation.

  .Handling of edge cases (e.g., empty item list).

  .Exception handling scenarios.

4.)Testing Tools and Strategies:

->Used JUnit for testing service functionality.

->Verified that:

   .The PDF file is created successfully.

   .The file contains non-empty content.

   .Errors like invalid file paths are managed.

5.)Project Workflow:

->Input: Seller details, buyer details, and item list.

->Processing: Generates a structured invoice PDF.

->Output: Returns the file path of the created PDF.


6.)Error Handling:

->Validates input and handles edge cases.

->Manages file-related exceptions (e.g., missing directory).


7.)Outcome:

->Successfully generates well-formatted invoice PDFs.

->Modular and testable codebase.

->Easy to enhance for additional features like custom layouts or table formatting.
